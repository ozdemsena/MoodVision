# Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) with PyTorch

## Description
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch to recognize 7 basic human emotions from grayscale facial images using the FER-2013 dataset. Includes data augmentation to improve generalization.

## Features
- Recognizes emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
- PyTorch-based CNN with dropout to prevent overfitting
- Data augmentation: horizontal flip, random rotation, normalization
- Save and load trained models
- Inference script for single images

## Dataset
- FER-2013 Dataset (Kaggle): 48x48 grayscale images
- Training: 28,709 images
- Validation: 3,589 images
- Test: 3,589 images
